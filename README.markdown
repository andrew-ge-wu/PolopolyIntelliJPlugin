Atex Polopoly Plugin
====================

The plugin's only trick is to post a file to Polopoly CMS' import servlet.

You will need to configure url, username and password. Typical values are:

 - *url*: http://localhost:8080/polopoly/import
 - *username*: sysadmin
 - *password*: hopefully not the default password
